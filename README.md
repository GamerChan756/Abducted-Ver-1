# Abducted
This is the continuation of the demo I started about a game called "Abducted". Game updates will be added accordingly

Currect Build (8/23/24):
Currently, the main game play for the tutorial has been completed. Some UI elements and smaller changes will be made, such as tutorial screens, animation changes, and cutscenes. Also, the main first level, or The Basement, has main gameplay elements developed, such as using keys to open certain doors and activating a generator to activate the power, indicated through the lights eminating in the place. Some updates being made are enemy AI, progression to the next level, and UI elements for smoother game play.

Pitch:
You, a young undergraduate student, gets abducted by hooded figures who also kidnap your dog. You wake up in seemingly a basement of some kind with one main goal in mind: “Find your dog and get out of there.” But you are not alone, so good luck and who knows, maybe secrets will be discovered about where you are.

Platforms:
“Abducted” will be primarily a pc game, but could be transferred to the console platform later.

Genre:
My game is a multi-genre game, mostly focusing on the horror-survival and puzzle aspect. Horror comes into play with the mysterious sounds that play and the enemies that wander around the place you need to avoid. It is horror-survival by being granted the ability to either avoid enemies by hiding in rooms or lockers, or by obtaining a satiable means of attacking and damaging enemies. The puzzle aspect will be in the form of finding items that will grant access to another section of the facility you are in, such as a key to open a certain door or a passcode to open a container to obtain an item to move forward.

Mechanics:
The player will need to go through a series of objectives/puzzles to proceed through the story of the game. The player can interact with items present in the game and sometimes there are little hidden items that can either make the adventure easier or reveal hidden secrets and story elements not presented explicitly to the player until way later. Some doors will be inaccessible until a certain item is collected, such as bolt cutters, lock picks, or keys, or an objective is completed, such as figuring out the combination to a padlock. The player will also be required to use stealth to avoid enemies by being cautious of where they are going and learning enemy behavior.

Controls:
WASD - Movement
Space - Jump
Left Shift - Sprint
E - Interact
F - Flashlight ON/OFF

Overview (Demo):
	The game begins with you having a peaceful night stroll in your city with your dog. Because it is night, you know your dog will protect you and you would do the same for him, so you have no worries. Your dog smells something interesting and, while he investigates in case it is a threat, you decide to stay where you are so he can find you. After scrolling on your phone for a bit, you hear a dog howl, and you immediately realize it is your dog. You remembered you saw him crawl under a fence blocking an alley way, and since the other ways are blocked off for reconstruction, you must find a way to break the chains holding the gate shut in order to pass through. After completing said task, you head out to find your dog, but when you see him trapped in someone else’s car, you black out for an unknown amount of time.
	Waking up, you realize you’re now in a room, a building of some kind. The door to the room is locked shut and finding a flashlight, you look around and see a rusty lock pick. Perhaps it will work one more time in your favor? Breaking out of the room, you remember your dog was taken, maybe by the same people you brought you here? Walking around for a bit, you discover two things: The stair way door to the basement is jammed shut, so it won’t open no matter what you do; and the elevator appears to work, but the power needs to be restored. On the ground you see a key with a tag on the end with a letter. Didn’t one of the rooms have a letter on the door? After discovering you need to find a generator, you hear a strange sound. A growl? A howl from a wolf? You have no idea. Looking at where it came from, you see a weird creature that appears to be a wolf, but it looks disfigured and it looks unsettling. Realizing that now you must open different rooms to get to the generator and must avoid a monster from who knows what, you need to be sneaky.
	Powering on the generator, you go back to the elevator and see it works, but there are only two floor buttons. With no other choice, you push the button not for the basement and, exiting on the new floor, you see a cell with someone inside. After talking to them a bit and asking what the heck is going on, they say “I have no idea, but maybe you woke up in the basement when know one else did for a reason.” Realizing you are the only one who is free to help, you decide to find a way out, find your dog, free as many people as you can, and find out the secrets this place has in store.

Aesthetics:
 •	Visual
The game will be in a 3D space with props for environment, street assets, and basement décor. Some text will be displayed to the player in a tutorial based format to explain what different keys do in the game and when to use them, if applicable. 
•	Audio
There will be audio for player walking/running/jumping, player voice lines, sound effects for player’s dog, and enemy sound effects (walking, growls, etc.).

Narrative:
•	Premise
The player been abducted by unknown people and must find a way to escape the complex.
•	Setting
The main tutorial part of the game will take place in an empty street and the rest will take place in some type of complex.
•	Characters
There are four different characters in the game so far. There is your player persona named Eloísa; your dog, Sparkk, whom you love and care for dearly; Character you talk to after leaving the basement; and the main enemy you encounter while in the basement.
•	Plot
As you progress through the game, you start to understand things. The creatures you encounter aren’t living animals but are a product of fungi that can take the shape of animals and people, but they are not fully able to look exactly like them yet. It is also extremely dangerous and hostile when standing too close to them. You also find out that the people behind this belong to a mafia, science corps called “Alluvial Corps” that believes future generations of humans will not be as capable or smart as previous generations and wants to control these fungi and help them become humans so they can rebirth the human generation in a new form. To keep the mouths shut of people who have been nosey, the corps would kidnap those they love the most and threaten to kill them if they speak out. Your father is one of these people and it is why they took you, his daughter whom he loves more than his own life.

Technology/Development Tools:
The game will be primarily made through Unity and it will use assets from the unity asset store, VRoid studio, and Blender.
