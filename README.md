# Abducted
This is the continuation of the demo I started about a game called "Abducted". Game updates will be added accordingly

Currect Build (8/23/24):
Currently, the main game play for the tutorial has been completed. Some UI elements and smaller changes will be made, such as tutorial screens, animation changes, and cutscenes. Also, the main first level, or The Basement, has main gameplay elements developed, such as using keys to open certain doors and activating a generator to activate the power, indicated through the lights eminating in the place. Some updates being made are enemy AI, progression to the next level, and UI elements for smoother game play.

Pitch:
You, a young undergraduate student, gets abducted by hooded figures who also kidnap your dog. You wake up in seemingly a basement of some kind with one main goal in mind: “Find your dog and get out of there.” But you are not alone, so good luck and who knows, maybe secrets will be discovered about where you are.

Platforms:
“Abducted” will be primarily a pc game, but could be transferred to the console platform later.

Genre:
My game is a multi-genre game, mostly focusing on the horror-survival and puzzle aspect. Horror comes into play with the mysterious sounds that play and the enemies that wander around the place you need to avoid. It is horror-survival by being granted the ability to either avoid enemies by hiding in rooms or lockers, or by obtaining a satiable means of attacking and damaging enemies. The puzzle aspect will be in the form of finding items that will grant access to another section of the facility you are in, such as a key to open a certain door or a passcode to open a container to obtain an item to move forward.
