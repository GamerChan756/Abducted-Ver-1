Overview-	Hello viewers and welcome to "Abducted". Abducted is a 3D, first person experience that falls under the horror, adventure genre. The setting takes place in a modern city where you, the player named Elo√≠sa, an undergraduate college student, are abducted while trying to find your dog and taken to an unknown facility. Realizing you need to get out there, you solve puzzles, avoid enemies, and construct the story hidden throughout the complex.

How to play- 
PC:

Bugs/In Progress-
The game runs up to when you open the door to the room with the generator. You are able to click the flashlight on and off after you collect it and certain doors or fences can be opened after you get the item needed to open them. However, there is no enemy added to the basement yet and the generator does not work at the moment, but those are the next main steps to implement. There is also a lack of cutscenes that would be used to drive the story forward and show your dog ran away as well as who abducted you. The flashlight beam itself is also too big and needs to be smaller, and there needs to be text showing when things are interactable and displaying new controls to make gameplay more enjoyable. The narrative also isn't implied yet. Afterwards, I will implement later levels to the complex and different path routes the player could use.
